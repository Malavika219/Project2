Cyberbullying has a negative impact on the mental health of individuals, leading to increased levels of anxiety, depression, or even suicidal ideation.

So here in this project I'm trying to predict possible cyber bullies and help people .

This project aims to predict potential cybersecurity threats using machine learning techniques.
By analyzing historical data on network activity, attacks, and system behavior, the model identifies patterns that may indicate malicious activity. 
This predictive model can help organizations proactively defend against cyberattacks.
