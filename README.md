Cyberbullying has a negative impact on the mental health of individuals, leading to increased levels of anxiety, depression, or even suicidal ideation.

So here in this project I'm trying to predict possible cyber bullies and help people .

This project focuses on detecting cyberbullying in online text using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. With the increasing use of social media and digital communication platforms, cyberbullying has become a serious concern. The goal of this project is to build a model that can automatically identify and classify instances of cyberbullying, helping to create safer digital environments.

The model is trained on labeled text data and is capable of distinguishing between different types of harmful content (e.g., insults, threats, hate speech) and non-offensive language. This solution can be integrated into social platforms, moderation tools, or educational software.
